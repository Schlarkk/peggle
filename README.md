A school project where I have to remake a peggle like game and give my own spin to it

# Game Idea/Inspirations
This game will be based off of many things and is planned to be sorta big with its features.. so stay with me here.

Of course the main thing about this game will be peggle, you shoot out orbs and blast away pegs to gain points.
Now we are going into the difficult parts

The theme of this game will be based off **Lobotomy Corperation** which is a managment sim developed by **Project moon** a Korean game studio.

I am very fond of this game and really like the artstyle and general lore of said game.
So I wanted to make a fan game of **Lobotomy Corperation** called

# Enkephalin Factory

<img width="426" height="160" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/162ca670-8130-4fa1-b76d-81fc0c551499" />

**Enkephalin Factory** will be name of the game I am making, this game's main goal is to extract *Enkephalin* from abnormalities, this is also the main goal in **Lobotomy Corperation**.
*Enkephalin* is a resource that gets extracted from abnormalities their emotions and is the points in my game and is what ditermens your score in the end.
Said resource also needs to be managed as this game is endless, there are no levels with set orbs to shoot.
Instead of having a set orbs you can shoot, you need to craft said orbs from *Enkephalin* one orb would cost 60 *Enkephalin*

To go further with said orbs, there will be 7 types of orbs based off the **Sins** in *Limbus Company** another game made by **Project Moon**

The 7 sins include
- Wrath : Red
- Lust : Orange
- Sloth : Yellow
- Gluttony : Green
- Gloom : Light Blue
- Pride : Blue
- Envy : Purple

All of these wont do anything different by themselves instead they will deal different types of damage against pegs

The pegs across the map will all be different as there will be seperate levels
Most of them will also have a corosponding colour to them that then also tells you what **Sin** they are weak to.

Once you have broken enough pegs you should get to the second stage and the background might change and new pegs will spawn.
Once you reach stage 5, you get to a *boss stage* where a random abnormality of 5 levels escapes and blocks you path created a giant wall at the bottom.

All abnormalities will have a specific weakness to a **Sin** so it is good to manage them

After beating an Abnormality you have a 45% chance of getting a random E.G.O Gift
These E.G.O gifts will have different effects on the player and their orbs, these could range from:"Buffing wrath damage for 4%" to "Shoot speed is increased by 20%" its up to luck on how good they can be.
There will be different rarities to said E.G.O Gifts so you know how good they should be. These same Rarities are also used as the danger level for Abnormalities

- ZAYIN : The lowest, usually an easy boss and wont effect the player much, their gifts will also be pretty low and can only range from ZAYIN - TETH level.
- TETH : The second lowest, usually the same as ZAYIN with more hp and maybe having an attacking move that could confuse the player, gifts can range from ZAYIN - TETH level
- HE : The middle child, these can be dangerous but harmless at the same time, just watch out and always be on high alert, their gifts can range from ZAYIN - WAV level
- WAV : The second most dangerous, these can be a bother. Having a lot more hp and alwasy having something to attack with these will be difficult to manage against, their gifts can range from ZAYIN - WAV level
- ALEPH : THE most dangerous, this are difficult to beat without being far in the game, luckily they can only spawn past stage 10 and have way more health and attacks even being able to change things in the playing field to fuck with you, Their gifts are always ALEPH level.


These are all the core core mechanics, there is one extra mechanic I would like to add
**EGO**
EGO, would be a chargeble bar above your **Sin** chargers that if charged with enough **Enkephalin** would allow you to use a special attack of sorts, usually dealing white damage with does 2x against everything, they can be really helpfull when you need to do massive damage in short time, or clear out a stage quickly



# Things aready finished for now
Currently there isn't much finished about the game except for the main menu, as the actualy game is still a big old placeholder, most of it is just gray squars and such with the main menu actually looking alright.
Underneath will be multiple gifs showing the Main menu + an audio file of the main song used.
